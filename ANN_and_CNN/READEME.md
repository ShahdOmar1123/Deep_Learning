## 🧠 Difference Between ANN and CNN

### 🔹 **ANN (Artificial Neural Network)**
- A general neural network used for various types of data (such as numbers or text).
- Consists of **fully connected layers** (each neuron is connected to every neuron in the next layer).
- **Common uses:**
  - Regression (value prediction)
  - Classification
  - Working with non-visual data (tabular data)

---

### 🔹 **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**
- A specialized type of neural network designed for image and video data.
- Includes **Convolution** and **Pooling** layers that automatically extract features from images.
- **Common uses:**
  - Image recognition
  - Video analysis
  - Medical image processing (segmentation)

### ⚖️ **Key Differences Between ANN and CNN**

| Comparison | ANN | CNN |
|-------------|-----|-----|
| Data Type | General (numbers, text) | Images and videos |
| Layers | Fully connected only | Convolution + Pooling + Fully connected |
| Feature Extraction | Manual | Automatic |
| Performance on Images | Weak | Excellent |

> 💡 **Summary:**  
> ANN is a general-purpose neural network for any kind of data,  
> while CNN is specialized for visual data and automatically learns spatial features.
